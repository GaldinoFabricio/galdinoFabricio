## 🧠 About Me

I'm a fullstack developer with a strong focus on backend. My passion for technology started early with video games, and evolved into a love for building efficient systems and APIs.

I currently work at **Cebraco - Serviço de Informação**, where I’ve been part of the team for 3 years. One of my most significant contributions was identifying and resolving a critical SQL performance issue on a query handling over 2 million records. This optimization not only improved response times but also prevented an expensive infrastructure upgrade.

I’m motivated by solving real problems and continuously learning to improve my skills and deliver clean, scalable code.
